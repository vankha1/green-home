# GREEN HOME

Green Home is a IoT mobile application that provides environmental information such soil moisture, humidity, or may be more. With Green Home, farmers can easily monitor and control some devices, including lighting, water pump and led.

## Features

1. Environmental Monitoring: we have four environmental indexes, including temperature, soil moisture, luminosity and humidity. Every time, these indexes are updated, we also update and display that information in charts.
And if one of these indexes are out of range, there is a warning notifying the user.

2. Device controls: we have three different device controls that are available to the application and can be used to monitor and control.

## Tech stack

* Frontend: React Native
* Backend: NodeJS, Socket.io
